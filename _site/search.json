This is now seen to be a significant contributor to pathology. Recently the tenet of the privileged status of the brain, regarding microbial compromise, has been questioned, particularly in terms of neurodegenerative diseases. It is now being considered that microbiological incursion into the central nervous system could be either an initiator or significant contributor to these. This is a novel study using 16S ribosomal gene-specific Next generation sequencing (NGS) of extracted brain tissue. A comparison was made of the bacterial species content of both frozen and formaldehyde fixed sections of a small cohort of Alzheimer-affected cases with those of cognitively unimpaired (normal). Our findings suggest an increase in bacterial populations in Alzheimer brain tissue compared with normal.\n\n\nCitation\nEmery, D. C., Shoemark, D. K., Batstone, T. E., Waterfall, C. M., Coghill, J.

To investigate microbial diversity and quantity in the brain, the profile of infectious agents was examined in pathologically normal and abnormal brains from persons with HIV/AIDS [HIV] (n = 12), other disease controls [ODC] (n = 14) and in cerebral surgical resections for epilepsy [SURG] (n = 6). Deep sequencing of cerebral white matter-derived RNA from the HIV (n = 4) and ODC (n = 4) patients and SURG (n = 2) groups revealed bacterially-encoded 16 s RNA sequences in all brain specimens with α-proteobacteria representing over 70% of bacterial sequences while the other 30% of bacterial classes varied widely. Bacterial rRNA was detected in white matter glial cells by in situ hybridization and peptidoglycan immunoreactivity was also localized principally in glia in human brains. Analyses of amplified bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences disclosed that Proteobacteria was the principal bacterial phylum in all human brain samples with similar bacterial rRNA quantities in HIV and ODC groups despite increased host neuroimmune responses in the HIV group. Exogenous viruses including bacteriophage and human herpes viruses-4, -5 and -6 were detected variably in autopsied brains from both clinical groups. Brains from SIV- and SHIV-infected macaques displayed a profile of bacterial phyla also dominated by Proteobacteria but bacterial sequences were not detected in experimentally FIV-infected cat or RAG1−/− mouse brains. Intracerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into RAG1−/− mice revealed a preponderance of α-proteobacteria 16 s RNA sequences in the brains of recipient mice at 7 weeks post-implantation, which was abrogated by prior heat-treatment of the brain homogenate. Thus, α-proteobacteria represented the major bacterial component of the primate brain’s microbiome regardless of underlying immune status, which could be transferred into naïve hosts leading to microbial persistence in the brain.\n\n\nCitation\nBranton, W.

    "text": "The Brain Microbiome Atlas (BMA) aims to compile open-source data on the gut-brain axis and the possibility of a brain microbiome to help advance this exciting area of research. Open-source data has been aggregated on the following subjects.\n\nThe Gut-Brain Axis\nThe gut microbiome consists of commensal or mutualistic bacteria which reside in the gastrointestinal tract and are involved in digestion, metabolism, regulation of the immune system, and protection against pathogens. The “gut-brain axis” is a term coined to describe the complex communication systems that appear to exist between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system and are associated with differences in physiology, behavior, and disease progression.\n\n\nDisease-Associated Microbes\nThe brain itself has traditionally been considered a sterile environment or a “dead end” for microbes. The brain’s first line of defense, the blood-brain barrier, is thought to limit the intrusion of bacteria from the blood into the brain. Bacteria that evade the blood-brain barrier and proliferate in the brain can result in life-threatening inflammation. There is strong evidence linking neurodegenerative diseases with a compromised blood-brain barrier, and considerable work has been done to associate this with microbial infection of the brain.\n\n\nThe Brain Microbiome\nStudies investigating the relationship between neurodegeneration and microbiota have also produced evidence of microbes in the brains of healthy control cases, which suggests there may exist bacteria endogenous to the brain. Endogenous bacteria in the brain (a “brain microbiome”) would consist of a set of microbes that persist (but not necessarily replicate) in the brain, the population of which is primarily quiescent and/or maintained by low level diffusion across the blood-brain barrier and active removal. If there is a “healthy” brain microbiome, one that exists in the absence of trauma and infection, it could represent a previously unknown mechanism by which the physiology of the brain is regulated."

The etiology of this disease remains a matter of intensive research in many laboratories. We have advanced the idea that disseminated fungal infection contributes to the etiology of AD. Thus, we have demonstrated that fungal proteins and DNA are present in nervous tissue from AD patients. More recently, we have reported that bacterial infections can accompany these mycoses, suggesting that polymicrobial infections exist in AD brains. In the present study, we have examined fungal and bacterial infection in brain tissue from AD patients and control subjects by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we have documented the fungal and bacterial species in brain regions from AD patients and control subjects by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our results from the analysis of ten AD patients reveal a variety of fungal and bacterial species, although some were more prominent than others. The fungal genera more prevalent in AD patients were Alternaria, Botrytis, Candida, and Malassezia. We also compared these genera with those found in elderly and younger subjects. One of the most prominent genera in control subjects was Fusarium. Principal component analysis clearly indicated that fungi from frontal cortex samples of AD brains clustered together and differed from those of equivalent control subjects. Regarding bacterial infection, the phylum Proteobacteria was the most prominent in both AD patients and controls, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroides. At the family level, Burkholderiaceae and Staphylococcaceae exhibited higher percentages in AD brains than in control brains. These findings could be of interest to guide targeted antimicrobial therapy for AD patients. Moreover, the variety of microbial species in each patient may constitute a basis for a better understanding of the evolution and severity of clinical symptoms in each patient.\nKeywords: polymicrobial infection, Alzheimer’s disease, infection in aging brain, fungal infection, next generation sequencing, bacteria and fungal co-infections\n\n\nCitation\nAlonso, R., Pisa, D., Fernández-Fernández, A.

Bacterial genomes and proteins are detected in brains from humans, nonhuman primates, rodents and other species in the absence of neurological disease. We investigated the composition and abundance of microbiota in frozen and fixed autopsied brain samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and age- and sex-matched nonMS patients as controls, using neuropathological, molecular and bioinformatics tools. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed Proteobacteria to be the dominant phylum with restricted diversity in cerebral white matter (WM) from MS compared to nonMS patients. Both clinical groups displayed 1,200–1,400 bacterial genomes/cm3 and low bacterial rRNA:rDNA ratios in WM. RNAseq analyses showed a predominance of Proteobacteria in progressive MS patients’ WM, associated with increased inflammatory gene expression, relative to a broader range of bacterial phyla in relapsing-remitting MS patients’ WM. Although bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivities were observed in all patients, PGN immunodetection was correlated with demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS brains. Principal component analysis revealed that demyelination, PGN and inflammatory gene expression accounted for 86% of the observed variance. Thus, inflammatory demyelination is linked to an organ-specific dysbiosis in MS that could contribute to underlying disease mechanisms.\n\n\nCitation\nBranton, W. G., Lu, J. Q., Surette, M.
