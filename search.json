This is now seen to be a significant contributor to pathology. Recently the tenet of the privileged status of the brain, regarding microbial compromise, has been questioned, particularly in terms of neurodegenerative diseases. It is now being considered that microbiological incursion into the central nervous system could be either an initiator or significant contributor to these. This is a novel study using 16S ribosomal gene-specific Next generation sequencing (NGS) of extracted brain tissue. A comparison was made of the bacterial species content of both frozen and formaldehyde fixed sections of a small cohort of Alzheimer-affected cases with those of cognitively unimpaired (normal). Our findings suggest an increase in bacterial populations in Alzheimer brain tissue compared with normal.\n\n\nCitation\nEmery, D. C., Shoemark, D. K., Batstone, T. E., Waterfall, C. M., Coghill, J.

    "text": "The Brain Microbiome Atlas (BMA) aims to compile open-source data on the gut-brain axis and the possibility of a brain microbiome to help advance this exciting area of research. Open-source data has been aggregated on the following subjects.\n\nThe Gut-Brain Axis\nThe gut microbiome consists of commensal or mutualistic bacteria which reside in the gastrointestinal tract and are involved in digestion, metabolism, regulation of the immune system, and protection against pathogens. The “gut-brain axis” is a term coined to describe the complex communication systems that appear to exist between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system and are associated with differences in physiology, behavior, and disease progression.\n\n\nDisease-Associated Microbes\nThe brain itself has traditionally been considered a sterile environment or a “dead end” for microbes. The brain’s first line of defense, the blood-brain barrier, is thought to limit the intrusion of bacteria from the blood into the brain. Bacteria that evade the blood-brain barrier and proliferate in the brain can result in life-threatening inflammation. There is strong evidence linking neurodegenerative diseases with a compromised blood-brain barrier, and considerable work has been done to associate this with microbial infection of the brain.\n\n\nThe Brain Microbiome\nStudies investigating the relationship between neurodegeneration and microbiota have also produced evidence of microbes in the brains of healthy control cases, which suggests there may exist bacteria endogenous to the brain. Endogenous bacteria in the brain (a “brain microbiome”) would consist of a set of microbes that persist (but not necessarily replicate) in the brain, the population of which is primarily quiescent and/or maintained by low level diffusion across the blood-brain barrier and active removal. If there is a “healthy” brain microbiome, one that exists in the absence of trauma and infection, it could represent a previously unknown mechanism by which the physiology of the brain is regulated."

Bacterial genomes and proteins are detected in brains from humans, nonhuman primates, rodents and other species in the absence of neurological disease. We investigated the composition and abundance of microbiota in frozen and fixed autopsied brain samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and age- and sex-matched nonMS patients as controls, using neuropathological, molecular and bioinformatics tools. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed Proteobacteria to be the dominant phylum with restricted diversity in cerebral white matter (WM) from MS compared to nonMS patients. Both clinical groups displayed 1,200–1,400 bacterial genomes/cm3 and low bacterial rRNA:rDNA ratios in WM. RNAseq analyses showed a predominance of Proteobacteria in progressive MS patients’ WM, associated with increased inflammatory gene expression, relative to a broader range of bacterial phyla in relapsing-remitting MS patients’ WM. Although bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivities were observed in all patients, PGN immunodetection was correlated with demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS brains. Principal component analysis revealed that demyelination, PGN and inflammatory gene expression accounted for 86% of the observed variance. Thus, inflammatory demyelination is linked to an organ-specific dysbiosis in MS that could contribute to underlying disease mechanisms.\n\n\nCitation\nBranton, W. G., Lu, J. Q., Surette, M.
